Saving Bob - Post Mortem


Making Saving Bob has been one wild ride. My experience making a similar game with a game engine gave me high hopes for this. 
I knew exactly what I wanted to make with this one. This coupled with the 1 month dead line gave me quite the delusions of 
grandeur.

What went right:

The research at the beginning want great! Putting textures on the screen and animating them came to me like it was nothing.
Left over knowledge from the other game I developed was really coming in handy. The hopes and ideas where flying high at
this point.

What went wrong:

After all the patting myself on the back, I dove into the meat of the project where I started to hit road block after road block.
The first one being, projectiles. This ate a lot of my time, being stubborn and wanting to figure it out myself. After a couple 
of days grinding at this I reluctantly ask for help. I had no idea the size of the question I was asking. This took a entire 
lecture and another day of work to get right. Quite a few other road blocks cropped up along the way, but none so great as
my other work obligations. A few unfortunate situations combined together stole most of the last two weeks of time I had left.
This caused so many features to get cut, far more than I ever thought I would have to. With the deadline at my door step, I had 
finish the game off in the quickest way I could.

While the game didn't turn out anything like I first envisioned, I had a lot of fun working on the and I learned so much from it.
